### Hardware and os relationship

`Hardware > kernel > operating system`

## Hardware
* processor
* ram
* storage
* other peripheral ( keyboard, mouse peripheral )
* monitor, display, printer


###  common Hardware(processor) for operating system     

1. x86 architecture -> complex set of instruction (intel + amd) -> (IBM - 60s)      
2. arm architecture -> simple set of instruction (opensource) - arm holdings (acorn computer limited (uk)) (4nm)

my case: i5 8400 -> 65w (14nm lithography)

### soc    

system on chip -> processor(cpu), DSP, GPU, Model, Bluetooth, rf, wifi


### rendering a 4k video in x86 processor vs arm processor

* i9 10th gen 4k 15 => 1h (125w)
* iphone 12 (arm) => 5m (5w)

Currently all new apple laptops come with arm processor.    

### OS
* ubuntu (linux)
* android (linux)
* mac os (unix)
* microsoft windows XP (windows)
* microsoft windows 10 (windows)
* microsoft windows 11 (windows)

### Companies 
* apple
